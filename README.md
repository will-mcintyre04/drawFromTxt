# drawFromTxt

This code takes in a .txt file with a series of coordinates indicating the position of a character.

The input file is formatted with the row size in the first line, and then a series of x and y coordinates seperated by a space followed by the character.
  
See file heart_mapped.txt as an example .txt file.

The maximum column and row lengths can also be set.
